    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a quick weekend hack, I built a tiny package manager called <strong>spm</strong> (Please don&rsquo;t ask me to abbreviate it) which uses <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/hawkey" target="_blank">Hawkey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tojaj/librepo" target="_blank">Librepo</a> for its dependency resolution and for downloading repository metadata. If you are familiar with DNF, then you might reach a conclusion that this sounds exactly like it, but, my main intention was to build a scaled down version of DNF. I have to confess that this is no where closer to DNF in terms of the feature set. Eventually, you will agree too.</p>

<p>So, I am <strong>open-sourcing</strong> it. Feel free to add to it and send me a PR. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>I will outline the steps that went into building spm so that you can build one too :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have a <strong>shell script</strong> that handles all your pre-execution steps like verbose printing and all. For example, this is the <em>install</em> pre-processing step that happens as defined in my shell script. <em>Notice how I am calling my main python driver program on line 8 for execution</em>
<code>
if [ "$#" -eq 2 ] &amp;&amp; [ "$1" == "install" ] ; then
  echo ""
  echo "SPM"
  echo ""
  echo "-----------------"
  echo "Install operation"
  echo "-----------------"
  echo `python /home/thejdeep/install.py $1 $2`
else
  echo ""
  echo "Correct Usage : spm install &lt;pkg_name&gt;"
  echo ""
fi
</code></p></li>
<li><p>In my main python program, have <strong>Hawkey</strong> configured to read my local repository. A brilliant tutorial that can help you do this can be found <a href="http://hawkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial-py.html#loading-repositories" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, use it to perform dependency resolution as shown <a href="http://hawkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial-py.html#resolving-things-with-goals" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>I have <strong>librepo</strong> set up to download the packages for me. Lifted this part of the code from <a href="https://github.com/Tojaj/librepo/blob/master/examples/python/download_package.py" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Now that I have the packages downloaded, I can safely install them using faithful ol' <em>RPM</em> :)
<code>
print "Installing packages"
print "-------------------"
cmd_ins = "sudo rpm -ivh " + pkg_url
subprocess.call(cmd_ins,shell=True)
</code></p></li>
<li>The other operations can be implemented in a similar way</li>
</ul>


<h3>TODO</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix dependency resolution. Right now, spm works correct only for packages that do not have dependencies. <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm/issues/1" target="_blank">Github Issue 1</a></p></li>
<li><p>Support installing multiple packages and all. Package names can be supplied as strings delimited by space to the install command. <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm/issues/2" target="_blank">Github Issue 2</a></p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/02/yum-vs-dnf-plugin-api/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-02T07:10:20+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/02/yum-vs-dnf-plugin-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last week or so, I was looking to port a YUM Plugin to DNF after considering the various potential advantages of DNF. During the process of conversion, I noticed a few differences in the Plugin API of both:</p>

<ul>
<li>DNF plugin API doesn&rsquo;t allow you to read arguments supplied through the CLI, atleast for now. Unlike the YUM Plugin API, where the <em>conduit</em> available in the <em>args_hook</em> has a function <em>getArgs()</em> which allows me to access the CLI arguments</li>
<li>There are a fewer number of hooks which the DNF Plugin API supports</li>
<li>The DNF plugin <strong>has</strong> to inherit from a parent class <em>dnf.cli</em></li>
</ul>


<p>To make the stand on this issue more clearer, I have written a basic <em>Hello World</em> plugin using both API&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A <em>Hello World</em> plugin written using the YUM Plugin API
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/7146d5311940ae03d068.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from yum.plugins import PluginYumExit , TYPE_CORE, TYPE_INTERACTIVE

requires_api_version = &#39;2.3&#39;
plugin_type = (TYPE_CORE, TYPE_INTERACTIVE)

def init_hook(conduit):
        print &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Similarly, a <em>Hello World</em> plugin written using the DNF Plugin API
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/d2d78776110e37699e9b.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import unicode_literals
from dnfpluginscore import _

import dnf
import dnf.exceptions
import os

class Test(dnf.Plugin):
        name=&#39;test&#39;
        def __init__(self,base,cli):
                super(Test,self).__init__(base,cli)
                self.base=base
                self.cli=cli
        def config(self):
                print &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre></noscript></div>

    <id>http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/yum-vs-dnf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot has been said already about which of the two RPM-based package managers to choose from - YUM or DNF. All the ramblings must have clearly started when Jan from the DNF team proclaimed that <em>YUM is dead, long live DNF!</em> in one of his famous rants on why Fedora 22 has its default package manager as DNF and not the faithful old YUM. You can find that great read <a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/2015/05/11/yum-is-dead-long-live-dnf/" target="_blank">here</a>. He also states the following reasons why YUM failed :</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken dependency solving algorithm</li>
<li>Undocumented API</li>
<li>Inability to refactor internal functions</li>
</ul>


<p>But, people seem to like YUM way better than DNF because it sounds better. Atleast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/36a1wq/yum_is_dead_long_live_dnf/" target="_blank">this</a> thread on Reddit says so.</p>

<p>On the similar point of view, there are a plenty of advantages in using DNF. Few of them are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a successful low-level SAT solver library for resolving dependencies. SUSE has been using this in production over the years</li>
<li>Downloading of the repository metadata and packages is done by Librepo, which is another component used by DNF.</li>
<li>Proven to be times faster than YUM. You can try running a list command in each.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although, DNF seems to fit the puzzle, there are a few disadvantages that might hold it back :</p>

<ul>
<li>Its a Work In Progress. The DNF team is working hard in porting all the legacy stuff of YUM to DNF. This might take some time.</li>
<li>Hogs bandwidth. Silently downloading metadata information in the background. Although, this can be tweaked and disabled in the configuration file, it poses to be a problem. You can read more about this issue <a href="https://hedayatvk.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/the-shiny-new-dnf-and-why-i-prefer-yum/" target="_blank">here</a> where the author states why this makes him prefer YUM over DNF.</li>
<li>DNF Plugin API isn&rsquo;t a fully baked product. Currently, the DNF API doesn&rsquo;t support reading command line arguments supplied through the CLI.</li>
</ul>


<p>In conclusion, if performance is a concern, DNF is the way to go.</p>
