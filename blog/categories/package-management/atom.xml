    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are times when you want to package software you have written and distribute it to others so that they can have it too. In this post, lets see how we can build a RPM for your software, which basically boils down to writing a SPEC file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of this, make sure you have the core development tools installed. You can do this by
<code>
$ sudo yum install rpmdevtools
</code>
<blockquote><p>NOTE : You should NEVER create your packages as the root user. Building RPM&rsquo;s as root is dangerous, because the binary files are installed on the system before being packaged, thus you must always build as normal user so you won&rsquo;t accidentally pollute your system. Create a new user for your package development tasks if you wish. Later don&rsquo;t tell me I didn&rsquo;t warn you :)</p><footer><strong><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package#Preparing_your_system" target="_blank">Source</a></strong></footer></blockquote></li>
<li>Create the required directory structure for creating a package by running the following command
<code>
$ rpmdev-setuptree
</code></li>
<li>You can now notice that ~/rpmbuild/ directory is created along with a few sub-folders inside</li>
<li>Now that the prerequisites are ready, we can go into actually building the package</li>
<li><em>Here&rsquo;s what I want to do</em> : I have a couple of files which I need to package. Eventually, when someone installs the package, I need those files to be copied to their respective locations. Simple ?</li>
<li>Create a <em>tar.gz</em> package containing all the files you want to package and move it to ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ folder.
<code>
$ mkdir ~/pkg_name
$ cd pkg_name
$ cp ~/file_1_location .
$ cp ~/file_2_location .
$ cp ~/file_3_location .
$ cd ..
$ tar cf pkg_name.tar.gz pkg_name
$ mv pkg_name.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
</code></li>
<li>Next, create a spec file in your ~/rpmbuild/SPECS directory
<code>
$ vi ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pkg_name.spec
</code></li>
<li>My final spec file is going to look like this. Will explain in detail in a bit

Will briefly explain what those lines in the spec file mean (skipping all the self explanatory ones)</p>

<p><em>Name</em> = Name of the package which should match the spec file name as well</p>

<p><em>%prep</em> = Commands to uncompress the program so as to make it build-ready</p>

<p><em>%setup</em> = To say what my archive unpacks to</p>

<p><em>%install</em> = Commands to install the program. To copy files from build dir to buildroot dir</p>

<p><em>%files</em> = List fo the files that will be installed</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So, thats it guys. Now that you have the spec file ready, just run this command
<code>
$ rpmbuild -v -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/pkg_name.spec
</code></p></li>
<li><p>After some such verbose printing, you will(might :/) have your built RPM in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<your_arch>/ . Ta-da ! :)</p></li>
</ul>

    <updated>2015-07-02T08:16:09+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/02/building-a-package-manager</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a quick weekend hack, I built a tiny package manager called <strong>spm</strong> (Please don&rsquo;t ask me to abbreviate it) which uses <a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/hawkey" target="_blank">Hawkey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tojaj/librepo" target="_blank">Librepo</a> for its dependency resolution and for downloading repository metadata. If you are familiar with DNF, then you might reach a conclusion that this sounds exactly like it, but, my main intention was to build a scaled down version of DNF. I have to confess that this is no where closer to DNF in terms of the feature set. Eventually, you will agree too.</p>

<p>So, I am <strong>open-sourcing</strong> it. Feel free to add to it and send me a PR. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>I will outline the steps that went into building spm so that you can build one too :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have a <strong>shell script</strong> that handles all your pre-execution steps like verbose printing and all. For example, this is the <em>install</em> pre-processing step that happens as defined in my shell script. <em>Notice how I am calling my main python driver program on line 8 for execution</em>
<code>
if [ "$#" -eq 2 ] &amp;&amp; [ "$1" == "install" ] ; then
  echo ""
  echo "SPM"
  echo ""
  echo "-----------------"
  echo "Install operation"
  echo "-----------------"
  echo `python /home/thejdeep/install.py $1 $2`
else
  echo ""
  echo "Correct Usage : spm install &lt;pkg_name&gt;"
  echo ""
fi
</code></p></li>
<li><p>In my main python program, have <strong>Hawkey</strong> configured to read my local repository. A brilliant tutorial that can help you do this can be found <a href="http://hawkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial-py.html#loading-repositories" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, use it to perform dependency resolution as shown <a href="http://hawkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial-py.html#resolving-things-with-goals" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>I have <strong>librepo</strong> set up to download the packages for me. Lifted this part of the code from <a href="https://github.com/Tojaj/librepo/blob/master/examples/python/download_package.py" target="_blank">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Now that I have the packages downloaded, I can safely install them using faithful ol' <em>RPM</em> :)
<code>
print "Installing packages"
print "-------------------"
cmd_ins = "sudo rpm -ivh " + pkg_url
subprocess.call(cmd_ins,shell=True)
</code></p></li>
<li>The other operations can be implemented in a similar way</li>
</ul>


<h3>TODO</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fix dependency resolution. Right now, spm works correct only for packages that do not have dependencies. <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm/issues/1" target="_blank">Github Issue 1</a></p></li>
<li><p>Support installing multiple packages and all. Package names can be supplied as strings delimited by space to the install command. <a href="https://github.com/thejdeep/spm/issues/2" target="_blank">Github Issue 2</a></p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/02/yum-vs-dnf-plugin-api/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-02T07:10:20+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/02/yum-vs-dnf-plugin-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last week or so, I was looking to port a YUM Plugin to DNF after considering the various potential advantages of DNF. During the process of conversion, I noticed a few differences in the Plugin API of both:</p>

<ul>
<li>DNF plugin API doesn&rsquo;t allow you to read arguments supplied through the CLI, atleast for now. Unlike the YUM Plugin API, where the <em>conduit</em> available in the <em>args_hook</em> has a function <em>getArgs()</em> which allows me to access the CLI arguments</li>
<li>There are a fewer number of hooks which the DNF Plugin API supports</li>
<li>The DNF plugin <strong>has</strong> to inherit from a parent class <em>dnf.cli</em></li>
</ul>


<p>To make the stand on this issue more clearer, I have written a basic <em>Hello World</em> plugin using both API&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A <em>Hello World</em> plugin written using the YUM Plugin API
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/7146d5311940ae03d068.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from yum.plugins import PluginYumExit , TYPE_CORE, TYPE_INTERACTIVE

requires_api_version = &#39;2.3&#39;
plugin_type = (TYPE_CORE, TYPE_INTERACTIVE)

def init_hook(conduit):
        print &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Similarly, a <em>Hello World</em> plugin written using the DNF Plugin API
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/d2d78776110e37699e9b.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>from __future__ import absolute_import

        def __init__(self,base,cli):
                super(Test,self).__init__(base,cli)
                self.base=base
                self.cli=cli
        def config(self):
                print &quot;Hello World&quot;

    <link href="http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/yum-vs-dnf/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-01T22:04:07+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://thejdeep.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/yum-vs-dnf</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot has been said already about which of the two RPM-based package managers to choose from - YUM or DNF. All the ramblings must have clearly started when Jan from the DNF team proclaimed that <em>YUM is dead, long live DNF!</em> in one of his famous rants on why Fedora 22 has its default package manager as DNF and not the faithful old YUM. You can find that great read <a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/2015/05/11/yum-is-dead-long-live-dnf/" target="_blank">here</a>. He also states the following reasons why YUM failed :</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken dependency solving algorithm</li>
<li>Undocumented API</li>
<li>Inability to refactor internal functions</li>
</ul>


<p>But, people seem to like YUM way better than DNF because it sounds better. Atleast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/36a1wq/yum_is_dead_long_live_dnf/" target="_blank">this</a> thread on Reddit says so.</p>

<p>On the similar point of view, there are a plenty of advantages in using DNF. Few of them are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a successful low-level SAT solver library for resolving dependencies. SUSE has been using this in production over the years</li>
<li>Downloading of the repository metadata and packages is done by Librepo, which is another component used by DNF.</li>
<li>Proven to be times faster than YUM. You can try running a list command in each.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although, DNF seems to fit the puzzle, there are a few disadvantages that might hold it back :</p>

<ul>
<li>Its a Work In Progress. The DNF team is working hard in porting all the legacy stuff of YUM to DNF. This might take some time.</li>
<li>Hogs bandwidth. Silently downloading metadata information in the background. Although, this can be tweaked and disabled in the configuration file, it poses to be a problem. You can read more about this issue <a href="https://hedayatvk.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/the-shiny-new-dnf-and-why-i-prefer-yum/" target="_blank">here</a> where the author states why this makes him prefer YUM over DNF.</li>
<li>DNF Plugin API isn&rsquo;t a fully baked product. Currently, the DNF API doesn&rsquo;t support reading command line arguments supplied through the CLI.</li>
</ul>


<p>In conclusion, if performance is a concern, DNF is the way to go.</p>
