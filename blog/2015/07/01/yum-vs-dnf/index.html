	<h2 class="title">YUM vs DNF</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>A lot has been said already about which of the two RPM-based package managers to choose from - YUM or DNF. All the ramblings must have clearly started when Jan from the DNF team proclaimed that <em>YUM is dead, long live DNF!</em> in one of his famous rants on why Fedora 22 has its default package manager as DNF and not the faithful old YUM. You can find that great read <a href="http://dnf.baseurl.org/2015/05/11/yum-is-dead-long-live-dnf/" target="_blank">here</a>. He also states the following reasons why YUM failed :</p>

<ul>
<li>Broken dependency solving algorithm</li>
<li>Undocumented API</li>
<li>Inability to refactor internal functions</li>
</ul>


<p>But, people seem to like YUM way better than DNF because it sounds better. Atleast, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/36a1wq/yum_is_dead_long_live_dnf/" target="_blank">this</a> thread on Reddit says so.</p>

<p>On the similar point of view, there are a plenty of advantages in using DNF. Few of them are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a successful low-level SAT solver library for resolving dependencies. SUSE has been using this in production over the years</li>
<li>Downloading of the repository metadata and packages is done by Librepo, which is another component used by DNF.</li>
<li>Proven to be times faster than YUM. You can try running a list command in each.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although, DNF seems to fit the puzzle, there are a few disadvantages that might hold it back :</p>

<ul>
<li>Its a Work In Progress. The DNF team is working hard in porting all the legacy stuff of YUM to DNF. This might take some time.</li>
<li>Hogs bandwidth. Silently downloading metadata information in the background. Although, this can be tweaked and disabled in the configuration file, it poses to be a problem. You can read more about this issue <a href="https://hedayatvk.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/the-shiny-new-dnf-and-why-i-prefer-yum/" target="_blank">here</a> where the author states why this makes him prefer YUM over DNF.</li>
<li>DNF Plugin API isn&rsquo;t a fully baked product. Currently, the DNF API doesn&rsquo;t support reading command line arguments supplied through the CLI.</li>
</ul>


<p>In conclusion, if performance is a concern, DNF is the way to go.</p>
